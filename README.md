## About Agora

Agora provides the background logic, management, and security for your tokenized
communities.

It consists of a web user interface that allows users to connect to one of the
many communities or create their own, and a chatbot, Medousa, that does all the
dirty work from removing intruders to providing extra privileges to premium
users.
